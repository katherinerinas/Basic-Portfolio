	<p> I studied psychology at the University of Kansas for my undergraduate degree. I studied abroad in Ireland for a semester and played basketball for University College Cork. I then went for a year of Medical Laboratory Science school at a hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. I then moved to denver and worked for National Jewish Health for three years before moving to Boulder Community Health for one year. The laboratory offered a great learning experience, but I am excited about the creative possibilities offered by the world of web development.
